    <h1>Hi, I'm Sandra</h1>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m a <u>developer experience engineer</u>. My job is to make the
      experience of using a technology more pleasant and seamless, focusing on
      the things that matter to software engineers and web developers: tools,
      documentation, UI, processes, and education.
    </p><p>
      With a background in teaching and front-end engineering, I also have a
      love for design, UX, and design systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently building the developers platform at <a
        href="https://deepgram.com/"
        target="_blank">Deepgram</a
      > and writing content about web development.
